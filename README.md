San Francisco Crime Patterns
Monthly Crime Distribution
•	Crime types remain relatively constant across months, meaning seasonality doesn't have a big influence on crime types in San Francisco.
Crime Hotspot Maps
•	Trespassing, vandalism, loitering, and missing person reports are all concentrated around downtown and the Mission District.
•	These heatmaps help police departments and city planners identify areas needing more attention or resources.
